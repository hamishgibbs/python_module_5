## Overview
This module will introduce data management and dataset transformations in Python. Specifically, we will focus on reliably importing data, handling missing values, extracting data from combined dataset records, and manipulating data to produce analysis-ready datasets.

## The dataset
This module will use data from the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei Province, China, where the SARS-CoV-2 virus was first detected. The dataset is the linelist of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to Hubei Province hospitals. Some processing has already been done to translate the dataset to English, and harmonize hospital linelists from different providers. The data was originally sourced from:  [beoutbreakprepared](https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019/blob/master/covid19).

There are two versions available for this practical: 

Practical L1: [clean-hubei.csv](https://hamishgibbs.github.io/python_module_5/data/clean-hubei.csv)  
Practical L2: [hubei.csv](https://hamishgibbs.github.io/python_module_5/data/hubei.csv)  

## Structure

This module includes code chunks provided in-line. Tasks for each section of the practicals are also listed with bullet points. Relevent documentation for the functions and packages that are required to complete each task are also provided.

You are encouraged to develop your own programming style, use the provided documentation for reference, and attempt to find your own solution to each task. 

Solutions for the practicals:
